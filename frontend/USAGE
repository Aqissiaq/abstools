    How to use the ABS Frontend tools
    ---------------------------------

1. Build the dist/absfrontend.jar file with

   ant dist

2. Use the ABS frontend with

   bin/bash/parseABS [options] <absfiles>

3. Compile to Maude or Java

a) Compile to Maude with

   bin/bash/generateMaude <absfile>

   To run the model, start Maude (download it from
   http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/download/) and load the compiled model.
   Maude must be able to find ../interpreter/abs-interpreter.maude -
   either set the MAUDE_LIB environment variable or copy/symlink
   abs-interpreter.maude into the directory where the compiled model
   resides.

   After loading the model into Maude, start it with the command

   rew start .

   (This assumes that the model terminates - if it does not, you can
   restrict the number of rewrite steps via the usual options to the
   rewrite command.)

b) Compile to Java with

   bin/bash/generateJava [options] [-d <dir>] <absfiles>

   This will generate a Java file Main.java into <dir>.
   
   This file contains a standard "main" method, so after compiling
   this file with a standard Java compiler it can be executed with

   java -cp dist/absfrontend.jar:dir Main
