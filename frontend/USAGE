    How to use the ABS Frontend tools
    ---------------------------------

1. Build the dist/absfrontend.jar file with

   ant dist

   You may need to set the following variable:
   export ANT_OPTS=-Xmx1g

2. Use the ABS frontend with

   bin/bash/parseABS [options] <absfiles>

3. Compile to Maude or Java

a) Compile to Maude with

   bin/bash/generateMaude <absfile>

   To run the model, start Maude (download it from
   http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/download/) and load the compiled model.
   Maude must be able to find src/abs/backend/maude/abs-interpreter.maude -
   either set the MAUDE_LIB environment variable or copy/symlink
   abs-interpreter.maude into the directory where the compiled model
   resides.

   After loading the model into Maude, start it with the command

   rew start .

   (This assumes that the model terminates - if it does not, you can
   restrict the number of rewrite steps via the usual options to the
   rewrite command.)

b) Compile to Java with

      bin/bash/generateJava [options] [-d <dir>] <absfiles>
  
   OR

      java -cp dist/absfrontend.jar abs.backend.java.JavaBackend [-d <dir>] <absfiles>

   This will generate Java source files and corresponding .class files into <dir>, where
   additional subdirectories are created for each module.
   
   It is also possible to only generate the Java source files and not the .class files by using
   the -sourceonly option. In that case the resulting Java files have to be compiled
   by a standard Java compiler. For example,
   
      find <dir> -name '*.java'|xargs javac -classpath dist/absfrontend.jar 

   For each module that has a Main block, the generated files contain a class <ModuleName>.Main 
   with a standard "main" method, which can be executed like a standard Java program, e.g.:

      java -cp dist/absfrontend.jar:<dir> MyModule.Main
