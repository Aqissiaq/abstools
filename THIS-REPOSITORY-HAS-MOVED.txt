The abstools repository is now located at github:

https://github.com/abstools/abstools

If you have an existing checkout (with local changes and branches,
etc.), you can execute the following commands:

$ git remote rm origin

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:abstools/abstools.git

$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master

Repeat the last command for all of your local branches that track upstream
(e.g., if you checked out the typecheckpl branch locally).
