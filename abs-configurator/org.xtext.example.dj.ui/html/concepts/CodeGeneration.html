<h1>Code generation</h1>
	<p>
		The code generation involves the creation of the java files equivalent to the DeltaJ ones.<br/>
		If you try to compile an deltaJ file 'File.dj' in the 'src' folder, every element in the file will be translated to a java class
		and it will be created within the 'src-gen' folder in the 'packages.file' package. Since the package name is taken from the file name please
		use just characters and/or letters in an deltaJ file name if you want to generate it.
