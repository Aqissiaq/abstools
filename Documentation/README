In order to generate the documentation, Maven 2 is required.
Then issue the following command:

  mvn site

this will generate the documents into the target directory

The documentation uses the Doxia tool.
The Doxia tool has the advantage that it takes different input formats (which 
can even be mixed) and can generate different output formats. In particular, we 
do not have to use HTML to write the documentation. In addition, all our 
documentation sources are managed by our subversion repository.
Possible input source formats are for example:

  APT (simple ASCII based markup), Simplified DocBook, Xdoc, TWiki, and XHMTL.

We are currently mainly use APT, which is described here:

  http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html:wq:

Output formats are, for example:

  DocBook, XHMTL, Latex, PDF,...

With Maven 2 it is then (once configured) trivial to generate a (static) 
website from the sources. In fact I only have to type mvn site-deploy and it 
will update the website. For testing purposes the site is currently published 
on one of our servers:

        http://dijkstra.informatik.uni-kl.de/abstools/

Otherwise it is possible to run 

        mvn clean site:run

to start a local webserver at

        http://localhost:8080/

to view the website.
