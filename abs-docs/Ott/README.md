The ABS grammar
===============

This directory contains Karl Palmskog's formalization of Core ABS in
[ott](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/).  It was created during the
[HATS project](http://hats-project.eu/).

Preparation
-----------

1. Install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org), see
   https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html for instructions.

2. Install ott via opam:

        opam init
        opam install ott

Creating the pdf
----------------

Running `make` after installing ott will create the file `core-abs.pdf`.
