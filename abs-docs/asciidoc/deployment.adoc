== Deployment and Resource Modeling

This chapter describes how to model non-functional properties of systems: code
deployment on varying numbers and kinds of machines, and the effects of code
locality and different resource types such as CPU speeds, interconnection
bandwidth, etc. on the performance of a system.

ABS can be used to simulate the effects of deployment decisions on the cost
and performance of running a distributed system.  To achieve this, the
following aspects were added to ABS:

* A notion of _location_ to describe where a cog is executing (see
  <<sec:deployment-components>>)
* A notion of _time_ that allows us to observe the effects of deployment
  decisions (see <<sec:timed-abs>>)
* A notion of _cost_ of executing parts of a system, in terms of resource
  types like bandwidth and processor cycles (see <<sec:resources>>)

All language identifiers described in this section reside in the `ABS.DC`
module.



[[sec:cloudprovider]]
=== The CloudProvider API

Deployment components are usually managed by a _Cloud Provider_ instance.  The
Cloud Provider implements the life cycle shown in Figure
<<fig-instance-lifecycle>>.  A deployment component is _managed_ by a cloud
provider if it was created via one of the `launchInstance` methods.

The operations supported by deployment components during their lifecycle are
summarized in Table <<table-dc-lifecycle>>.

==== Datatypes and Constructors

The type for cloud provider instances is `ABS.DC.CloudProvider`.

Cloud provider instances are created with a `new CloudProvider(String name)`
expression.  It is not mandatory but recommended that each cloud provider
instance has a unique name.

It is recommended to call `setInstanceDescriptions` once after creating a
cloud provider to set the list of named instance types that this cloud
provider offers.


==== Methods

.setInstanceDescriptions

This method sets the named instance configurations that the cloud provider
instance should support.  These names are used in the methods
`launchInstanceNamed` and `prelaunchInstanceNamed`.

[source]
----
[Atomic] Unit setInstanceDescriptions(Map<String, Map<Resourcetype, Rat>> instanceDescriptions);
----

.getInstanceDescriptions

This method returns the map of named instance configurations.

[source]
----
[Atomic] Map<String, Map<Resourcetype, Rat>> getInstanceDescriptions();
----


.launchInstanceNamed

This method creates and returns a new deployment component with a resource
configuration corresponding to `instancename`, as set by the
`setInstanceDescriptions` method.  If no description for `instancename`
exists, `launchInstanceNamed` returns `null`.

[source]
----
DeploymentComponent launchInstanceNamed(String instancename);
----

The name of the new deployment component will be `"<Cloud provider
name>-<instancename>-<Counter>"`, i.e., a concatenation of the name of the
cloud provider itself, the instance name, and a unique integer as suffix.

If the instance description specifies a startup duration,
`launchInstanceNamed` will only return after that amount of simulated time has
elapsed.

The returned deployment component will be acquired (as per `acquireInstance`)
and can be used immediately.


.prelaunchInstanceNamed

This method creates and returns a new deployment component with a resource
configuration corresponding to `instancename`, as set by the
`setInstanceDescriptions` method.  If no description for `instancename`
exists, `prelaunchInstanceNamed` returns `null`.

[source]
----
DeploymentComponent prelaunchInstanceNamed(String instancename);
----

As with `launchInstance`, the name of the new deployment component will be
`"<Cloud provider name>-<instancename>-<Counter>"`, i.e., a concatenation of
the name of the cloud provider itself, the instance name, and a unique integer
as suffix.

The method `prelaunchInstanceNamed` returns immediately, but the method
`acquireInstance`, when called on the returned deployment component, will not
return before its startup duration (if specified) has elapsed.

The returned deployment component needs to be acquired (as per
`acquireInstance`) before it can be used.




.launchInstance

The `launchInstance` method creates and returns a new deployment component
with the specified resource configuration.  It can be used when, for whatever
reason, the resource configuration should not be registered with the cloud
provider, but the deployment component should still be managed by it.

[source]
----
DeploymentComponent launchInstance(Map<Resourcetype, Rat> description);
----

The name of the new deployment component will be `"<Cloud provider
name>-<Counter>"`, i.e., a concatenation of the name of the
cloud provider itself and a unique integer as suffix.

If the resource configuration specifies a startup duration,
`launchInstanceNamed` will only return after that amount of simulated time has
elapsed.

The returned deployment component will be acquired (as per `acquireInstance`)
and can be used immediately.


.prelaunchInstance

This method creates and returns a new deployment component with the specified
resource configuration.  As with `launchInstance`, this method can be used
when, for whatever reason, the resource configuration should not be registered
with the cloud provider, but the deployment component should still be managed
by it.

[source]
----
DeploymentComponent prelaunchInstance(Map<Resourcetype, Rat> d)
----

The name of the new deployment component will be `"<Cloud provider
name>-<Counter>"`, i.e., a concatenation of the name of the cloud provider
itself and a unique integer as suffix.

The method `prelaunchInstance` returns immediately, but the method
`acquireInstance`, when called on the returned deployment component, will not
return before its startup duration (if specified) has elapsed.

The returned deployment component needs to be acquired (as per
`acquireInstance`) before it can be used.


.acquireInstance

This method, together with `releaseInstance`, implements exclusive access to a
deployment component.  After `acquireInstance` returns true, all further
invocations will return false until `releaseInstance` is called for the
deployment component.

[source]
----
Bool acquireInstance(DeploymentComponent instance);
----

If the deployment component passed as argument was not created by the cloud
provider, the method returns false.

NOTE: The methods `acquireInstance` and `releaseInstance` are used to
implement exclusive access in a _cooperative_ manner.  Attempting to create a
cog on a deployment component without having acquired it beforehand will not
lead to a runtime error; ensuring exclusive access to deployment components is
the responsibility of the modeler.


.releaseInstance

This method releases the deployment component, such that the next call to
`acquireInstance` will return true.

[source]
----
Bool releaseInstance(DeploymentComponent instance);
----

This method returns true if the deployment component was successfully
released.  It returns false if the deployment component was already not
acquired.

If the deployment component passed as argument was not created by the cloud
provider, the method returns false.



.shutdownInstance

This method shuts down a deployment component.  The effect on the cogs,
objects and running tasks deployed on that deployment component are
backend-specific.

[source]
----
Bool shutdownInstance(DeploymentComponent instance);
----


[Atomic] Rat getAccumulatedCost();

[Atomic] Map<String, Map<Resourcetype, Rat>> getInstanceDescriptions();



[[sec:deployment-components]]
=== Deployment Components

In ABS, processes run inside cogs.  Deployment components are used to provide
a location to cogs.  Cogs residing on the same deployment component share the
resources provided by the deployment component.

Deployment Components are first-class constructs in the ABS language.  A
reference to a deployment component is treated the same way as a reference to
an object.  Deployment Components are created using the `new` expression.  Any
other cog can be created “on” a deployment component by using a `DC`
annotation to the `new` statement.

.Example
----
DeploymentComponent dc = new DeploymentComponent("Server 1", map[Pair(Speed, 10)]); <1>
[DC: dc] Worker w = new CWorker(); <2>
----
<1> A new deployment component `dc` is created with 10 `Speed` resources
<2> `w` is created on the new deployment component `dc`

NOTE: Deployment components cannot be created with `new local`, only with
`new`.

NOTE: All objects of a cog must reside on the same deployment component, i.e.,
`[DC: x] new local C()` is an error.

==== Resources and Deployment Components

As seen above, each deployment component “carries” some amount of resources
for each resource type.  This is expressed as a map from resource type to a
number, for example `map[Pair(Speed, 10), Pair(Bandwidth, 20)]`.  When no
amount is given for some resource type, it is infinite.  See <<sec:resources>>
for a description of the available resource types.

==== Methods

.[Atomic] Rat load(Resourcetype rtype, Int periods)

Return the load (0-100) for given resource type `rtype` over the last `n`
periods.  If resource is infinite, return `0`.

.[Atomic] InfRat total(Resourcetype rtype)

Return the total available amount for given resourcetype.  If the resource
type is infinite, return `InfRat`; if it has value _value_, return
`Fin(value)`.

.Unit transfer(DeploymentComponent target, Rat amount, Resourcetype rtype)

Transfer `amount` resources of type `rtype` from the current deployment
component to `target`.  Takes effect on the next time period.

(This method is implemented via `decrementResources` and
`incrementResources`.)

.Unit decrementResources(Rat amount, Resourcetype rtype)

Decrement available resourcetype by given amount from the next time interval
onwards.

.Unit incrementResources(Rat amount, Resourcetype rtype)

Increment available resourcetype by given amount from the next time interval
onwards.


.[Atomic] String getName()

Returns the name of the deployment component.  The name is set by the first
argument to the `new` expression.

.[Atomic] Time getCreationTime()

Get the creation time of the deployment component, in terms of the simulated clock.

.[Atomic] Rat getStartupDuration()

Get the specified startup duration, or 0 if none specified.

.[Atomic] Rat getShutdownDuration()

Get the specified shutdown duration, or 0 if none specified.


.[Atomic] Int getPaymentInterval()

Get the specified payment interval, or 1 if none specified.

.[Atomic] Rat getCostPerInterval()

Get the specified cost per interval, or 0 if none specified.


.Bool shutdown()

Shut down the deployment component.  It is an error to create a new object on
a deployment component that has been shutdown, or to invoke a method on an
object residing on a deployment component that has been shut down.

.[Atomic] Unit setProvider(CloudProvider provider)

Set the cloud provider that manages this deployment component.  See
<<sec:cloudprovider>> for a discussion of cloud providers.

.[Atomic] CloudProvider getProvider()

Get the cloud provider that manages this deployment component.  Returns `null`
if no cloud provider set.  See <<sec:cloudprovider>> for a discussion of cloud
providers.

.Bool acquire()

Convenience method for calling `acquireInstance` of the associated cloud
provider.  If no cloud provider is set, returns `True`.

.Bool release()

Convenience method for calling `releaseInstance` of the associated cloud
provider.  If no cloud provider is set, returns `True`.



[[sec:resources]]
=== Resource Types

The term “Resource” can be understood in different ways.  In ABS, we define
“Resource” to be a countable, measurable property of a deployment component.
Some resources stay constant throughout the life of a deployment component
(e.g., the number of cores), some others are influenced by program execution
(e.g., the available bandwidth in the current time slot).

The resource types currently supported by the ABS language are defined in the
`ABS.DC` module as follows:

----
data Resourcetype = Speed | Bandwidth | Memory | Cores ;
----

When a deployment component is created without explicitly giving a value for a
resource type, it is in effect infinite.  E.g., when we want to model a denial
of service attack, the deployment component modeling the attacker will have
infinite speed and bandwidth.


==== Speed

The `Speed` resource type models execution speed.  Intuitively, a deployment
component with twice the number of `Speed` resources will execute twice as
fast.  Not all statements consume Speed resources while executing -- Speed
resources are consumed when execution in the current process reaches a
statement that is annotated with a `Cost` annotation.

.Example
----
Time t1 = now();
[Cost: 5] skip;
Time t2 = now();
----

Executing the above `skip` statement will consume 5 Speed resources from the
deployment component where the cog was deployed.  If the deployment component
does not have infinite Speed resources, executing the `skip` statement might
take an observable amount of time, i.e., `t1` and `t2` might be different.


==== Bandwidth

Bandwidth is a measure of transmission speed.  Bandwidth resources are
consumed during method invocation and `return` statements.  No bandwidth is
consumed if sender and receiver reside on the same deployment component.

Bandwidth consumption is expressed via a `DataSize` annotation:

.Example
----
[DataSize: 2 * length(x)] o!m(x);
----

Executing the above method invocation statement will consume bandwidth
resources proportional to the length of list `x`.
// The resources will be
// consumed both from the deployment component where the cog was deployed, and
// from the one where `o` was deployed.


==== Memory

The `Memory` resource type abstracts from the size of main memory, as a measure
of how many and which cogs can be created on a deployment component.  In
contrast to bandwidth and speed, memory does not influence the timed behavior
of the simulation of an ABS model; it is used for static deployment modeling.


==== Cores

The `Cores` resource type expresses the number of CPU cores on a deployment
component.  It is used for static deployment decisions and does not have
influence on the timing behavior of simulations (use the `Speed` resource type
for this purpose).


=== Modeling Resource Usage

As described above, resource models are added to an ABS model using annotations.  Adding annotations to specific statements and declarations causes side-effects on the status of an applicable deployment component.

.Example
----
module Test;
import * from ABS.DC; <1>
interface I {
  Unit process();
}
[DataSize: 3] <2>
class C implements I {
  Unit process() {
    [Cost: 10] skip; <3>
}

{
  DeploymentComponent dc = new DeploymentComponent("Server",
    map[Pair(CPU, 5), Pair(Bandwidth, 10), Pair(Memory, 5)]);
  [DC: dc] I i = new C(); <4>
  [DataSize: 5] i!process(); <5>
}
----
<1> Make all necessary identifiers accessible in the current module

<2> Declare the memory needed to instantiate a cog of class `C`

<3> Executing this statement costs 10 CPU units; the time needed depends on
the CPU capacity of the deployment component, and on other cogs executing in
parallel on the same deployment component.  In this example, executing the
`skip` statement will take two time units.

<4> Creating a new cog succeeds since the available memory (5) is more than
the necessary memory (3).  Trying to create a second cog of the same class
will fail.

<5> Executing this method call consumes 5 Bandwidth resources.  Since `dc` has
10 bandwidth per time unit, the message will be transported instantly.
