=== Interface Types

Interfaces in ABS are similar to interfaces in Java. Unlike Java,
objects in ABS are typed exclusively by interfaces, and *not* classes.

To introduce an interface:

[source, java]

----
interface Animal {
...
}
----

Interfaces can be extended from (multiple) base interfaces: 

[source, java]

----
interface Bird extends Animal, Flying {
...
}
----

Let's consider the example of an object that represents a "seagull". Such
_seagull_ object can have either the type of a +Bird+, +Animal+ or +Flying+,
depending on the object's particular usage in the program. In terms of type theory, this feature is called 
__nominal subtyping__. An example of well-typed expressions that make use of Interface types:

----
seagull                     can be typed by: Bird or Animal or Flying
list[seagull, bee]          can be typed by: Animal or Flying
set[seagull, bee, boeing]   can be typed by: Flying
----
