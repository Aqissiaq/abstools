== Maude Backend

The Maude backend is a high-level, executable semantics in rewriting logic of
the ABS language.  Due to its relatively compact nature, it serves as a
test-bed for new language features.

Executing a model on the Maude backend results in a complete snapshot of the system state after execution has finished.

The main drawback of the Maude backend is its relatively poor performance, making it not very suitable to simulate large models.

Features:
- CPU and bandwidth resources
- Simulation of resource usage on deployment components
- Timed semantics
- Executable formal semantics of the ABS language
