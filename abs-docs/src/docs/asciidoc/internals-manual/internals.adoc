.About this guide

This guide is meant to help document how absc -- the ABS compiler -- works, as
well as to help new contributors get involved in development, and for using
ABS as basis for their own research.  It is meant as a high-level overview,
presenting the kinds of things that (ideally) do not change frequently.

Part 1 contains general information that should be useful no matter how you
are contributing.  Part 2 contains information about how various parts of the
compiler work.

This guide is currently a work-in-progress.  Contributions and corrections to
this guide are very welcome!

== How absc works

=== High-level overview of the compiler source

=== The command-line parser and dispatcher

The main entry point of the compiler is the class `org.abs_models.Absc`.  This class parses command-line arguments, parses the files given on the command line and dispatches to the desired backend.  There is also a possibility to register _sub-commands_ for distinct functionality; for example, software product line type checking is done by invoking the `checkspl` subcommand.  Subcommands have their own command-line options and help output.

The `Absc` class uses https://picocli.info[the picocli library] for command-line parsing.

=== Lexing and parsing

We currently use antlr4 for parsing ABS source code.  The grammar is at `frontend/src/main/antlr/org/abs_models/frontend/antlr/parser/ABS.g4`.

=== Abstract syntax tree rewriting

We use http://jastadd.org/web/[JastAdd] for the AST.  The AST node definitions for Core ABS are in `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/ast/CoreAbs.ast`; AST node definitions for Full ABS are in `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/ast/FullAbs.ast`.

The antlr parse tree is converted into JastAdd by the class `org.abs_models.frontend.antlr.parser.CreateJastAddASTListener`.

Tree attributes and aspects (for type checking, code generation etc.) are added via `.jadd` and `.jrag` files; these files can be added in any directory below `frontend/src/main/java`.

=== Typechecking

Code below `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/`.

Type checking is done in
`org.abs_models.frontend.parser:analyzeFlattenAndRewriteModel`, which should
be called by all backends.  For historical reasons, there are two passes of
type checking: `Model.getErrors` and `Main.typeCheckModel`.  The latter method
relies on some errors not being present that are detected by the former one,
so they should always be called in the same sequence as in
`analyzeFlattenAndRewriteModel`.

Types are represented as their own class hierarchy, separate from the AST node
classes.  See
`frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/Type.java` and its
subclasses.

Many AST nodes can calculate information about their type, via the `getType`
method that returns a `Type` object.  This is implemented in
`frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/Typing.jrag`

Type checking itself uses `Type` objects and the `getType` method to collect
type errors.  The methods `typeCheck` fill a `SemanticConditionList` with
`SemanticCondition` objects.

==== Type checker extensions

Note the possibility to write type checker extensions; see the `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/ext/` directory.

To implement a new type system extension, inherit from
`DefaultTypeSystemExtension` and override some of its methods.  Then, register
the extension by adding it to the `registerDefaultExtensions` method of the
`TypeExtensionHelper` class.

=== Backends and code generation

== The Erlang backend

=== Code Generation

The main entry point of the Erlang code generation system is the method `org.abs_models.backend.erlang.ErlangBackend.doMain`, which will be invoked by the `Absc` class.  Given a type-checked and preprocessed AST, the Erlang backend generates code in a subdirectory (by default `gen/erl/`) and then invokes the Erlang compiler.

The `gen/erl/` directory is pre-populated with the contents of `frontend/src/main/resources/erlang`, which includes both ABS runtime files in the subdirectory `absmodel/src/` and third-party support libraries below `absmodel/deps/`.
